## Interview Tips
1. Start with requirements clarification
2. Think out loud - explain your thought process
3. Consider scalability, reliability, and maintainability
4. Discuss trade-offs and alternatives
5. Ask clarifying questions

## Practice Resources
- Practice explaining each concept in your own words
- Draw diagrams for system design problems
- Code examples for design patterns
- Review real-world case studies
